		Over the years I have gained a few programming experiences. I have learned VB.NET, Java and some HTML. I transferred from Rockland County Community College with my Associates in Graphic Design. Some of the projects that I have worked on were making a temperature converter in VB.NET, Calculator in Java and some basic coding in HTLM (nothing too serious). I tend to like classes that incorporate both art and technology and find that both of them together make something amazing. I have been using computers my whole life whether it has been simple uses, for example Browsing the Internet, Microsoft Office or Gaming to the more extensive programs, for example Adobe Illustrator or Visual Basics. As I already said I have my associates in Graphic Design so I have a grasp on Ai and other Adobe programs. I know my way around both Mac and Windows Operating Systems and lean toward Mac/OSX. I also enjoy repairing, cleaning and building computers even though I haven't built my own yet (too much money). 

		<br><br>  I honestly love technology and would love to contribute to "The World of Computers". I see myself programming and designing alongside being a User to the things I make. This to ensure the best User experience. Computer programming will allow me to be at "Both Ends of the World", and from what I hear being able to do both is really good. I enjoy finding the easiest way possible to make a User happy. In the end it really is about the User Experience and being able to be one and contribute to many is what I truly want to do. Thank you for asking.
