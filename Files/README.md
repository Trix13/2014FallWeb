The fitness tracker needs to keep track of your weight, foods eaten and heart rate by user input.
This should be done almost everytime the user signs into the web account or have a button that they can click to start the input processes.
Calander use to make a schedule for daily fitness and foods.
Food information and User input food information (calories and sugars ext...)

Needs to look clean to keep up with the idea of clean eating and a healthy workout. 
Needs rewards, even for the smallest workout or the healthiest move to a healthy diet.
Calulations need to be done for the user (Calories eaten, miles run, hours worked out, ext...)

This is a general idea of what the site needs. Other ideas and improvements will come later in design.
